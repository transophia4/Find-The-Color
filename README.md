# Find The Color
### How to Play
Simply enter in the color that you want to find. Then click a tile and begin the game! The first person to find the colored tile wins. Play again by clicking reset.

### The Story
Inspired by my three year old sister and six year old brother, I made a game with simple mechanics and an easy interface. Due to its straightforward nature, this game is very easy for my younger siblings to understand and doesn't add any confusion with additional rules.

### What I Learned
This project helped me gain experience with React and Vite.
